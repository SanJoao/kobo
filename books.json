        "description": "<div>\n<p><strong>Na nova edição do livro que conquistou milhões de leitores ao redor do mundo, Yuval Noah Harari questiona tudo o que sabemos sobre a trajetória humana no planeta ao explorar quem somos, como chegamos até aqui e por quais caminhos ainda poderemos seguir.</strong> O planeta Terra tem cerca de 4,5 bilhões de anos. Numa fração ínfima desse tempo, uma espécie entre incontáveis outras o dominou: nós, humanos. Somos os animais mais evoluídos e mais destrutivos que jamais viveram. <br><em>Sapiens</em> é a obra-prima de Yuval Noah Harari e o consagrou como um dos pensadores mais brilhantes da atualidade. Num feito surpreendente, que já fez deste livro um clássico contemporâneo, o historiador israelense aplica uma fascinante narrativa histórica a todas as instâncias do percurso humano sobre a Terra. Da Idade da Pedra ao Vale do Silício, temos aqui uma visão ampla e crítica da jornada em que deixamos de ser meros símios para nos tornarmos os governantes do mundo. <br>Harari se vale de uma abordagem multidisciplinar que preenche as lacunas entre história, biologia, filosofia e economia, e, com uma perspectiva macro e micro, analisa não apenas os grandes acontecimentos, mas também as mudanças mais sutis notadas pelos indivíduos. \"Interessante e provocador. Nos traz a sensação de quão breve é o tempo em que estamos nesta Terra.\" — Barack Obama \"Recomendo <em>Sapiens</em> a qualquer pessoa que esteja interessada na história e no futuro de nossa espécie.\" — Bill Gates \"Uma incrível investigação para compreender o passado, situar o presente e pensar para onde iremos. Num momento de crise civilizatória, a obra de Harari é um convite à reflexão.\" — Djamila Ribeiro \" <em>Sapiens</em> não só trata das questões mais importantes da história de nossa espécie como é escrito numa linguagem vívida e inesquecível.\" — Jared Diamond \"O livro de Yuval Noah Harari é muito bom. Fui surpreendido por pontos de vista que nunca tinha imaginado.\" — Leandro Karnal \"O modo como Harari narra a história de nós, humanos, e enxerga nosso futuro é arrebatador.\" — Natalie Portman \" <em>Sapiens</em> é uma exploração fascinante sobre como aquilo que nos torna humanos é muito mais do que uma biologia notável: é o mundo mental que construímos em conjunto.\" — Suzana Herculano-Houzel</p></div>",

        "description": "<div><p>In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, <em>Limits to Growth</em>―the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet― Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001.</p>\n<p><em>Thinking in Systems</em>, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.</p>\n<p>Some of the biggest problems facing the world―war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation―are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.</p>\n<p>While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner.</p>\n<p>In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, <em>Thinking in Systems</em> helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.</p>\n<p>**</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>\n<p>Starred Review. Just before her death, scientist, farmer and leading environmentalist Meadows (1941-2001) completed an updated, 30th anniversary edition of her influential 1972 environmental call to action, Limits to Growth, as well as a draft of this book, in which she explains the methodology-systems analysis-she used in her ground-breaking work, and how it can be implemented for large-scale and individual problem solving. With humorous and commonplace examples for difficult concepts such as a \"reinforcing feedback loop,\" (the more one brother pushes, the more the other brother pushes back), negative feedback (as in thermostats), accounting for delayed response (like in maintaining store inventory), Meadows leads readers through the increasingly complex ways that feedback loops operate to create self-organizing systems, in nature (\"from viruses to redwood trees\") and human endeavor. Further, Meadows explicates methods for fixing systems that have gone haywire (\"The world's leaders are correctly fixated on economic growth ...but they're pushing with all their might in the wrong direction\"). An invaluable companion piece to Limits to Growth, this is also a useful standalone overview of systems-based problem solving, \"a simple book about a complex world\" graced by the wisdom of a profound thinker committed to \"shaping a better future.\" <br>\nCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An invaluable companion piece to <em>Limits to Growth</em>, this is also a useful standalone overview of systems-based problem solving, \"a simple book about a complex world\" graced by the wisdom of a profound thinker committed to \"shaping a better future.</p>\n<p>\"When I read <em>Thinking in Systems</em> I am reminded of the enormity of the gap between systemic thinkers and policy makers. If this book helps narrow the gap, it will be Dana's greatest contribution.\"<strong>--Lester Brown, founder and President, Earth Policy Institute</strong></p>\n<p>\"Dana Meadows' exposition in this book exhibits a degree of clarity and simplicity that can only be attained by one who profoundly and honestly understands the subject at hand--in this case systems modeling. Many thanks to Diana Wright for bringing this extra legacy from Dana to us.\"<strong>--Herman Daly, Professor, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland at College Park</strong></p>\n<p>\"Reading <em>Thinking in Systems</em> evokes the wisdom and even the voice of Dana Meadows. We are reminded of how she was not only one of the great systems thinkers, but also one of our greatest teachers. This is modestly called a primer, and indeed it is, but unlike most books with that title, this one quickly takes one from the elementary into deep systems thinking about issues as critical today as they were when Dana wrote these words. The discussion of oil use and the interaction of its extraction pattern with economic decision making should be required reading for all energy policy makers and energy company executives (as well as all informed citizens in a democracy). The fisheries case reminds us of how little any government or private actor has done to grasp the importance of takeout flows in determining stocks when the input flows are not within our control. The commentary on economics and, yes the need to consider limits, is a clear systems statement that clarifies a great deal of discussion that goes back to <em>The Limits to Growth</em>.</p>\n<p>It is remarkable that Dana is able to explain with such clarity such systems concepts of stocks, flows, feedback, time delays, resilience, bounded rationality, and system boundaries and to illustrate each one with multiple informative examples. Her statement that goals that optimize subsystems will sub optimize the functioning of the total system, is truly profound. As the book moves from the 'mechanics' of systems dynamics to Dana's more philosophical perspective, we are treated to her inherent belief in human values that consider the good of all, and how much more effective considering the needs of others is likely to be in solving larger, complex problems. The universe and our society may be very complex and operate in counterintuitive, non-liner fashion, but following the insights of this book and applying them will provide for far more effective solutions to the challenges of a 7 billion person planet than current incremental, linear responses by governments, corporations and individuals.\"<strong>--Bill Moomaw, Professor of International Environmental Policy at the Fletcher School, Tufts University</strong></p>\n<p>\"In Dana Meadows's brilliantly integrative worldview, everything causes everything else; cause and effect loop back on themselves. She was the clearest thinker and writer co-creating the art and science of systems dynamics, and <em>Thinking in Systems</em> distills her lifetime of wisdom. This clear, fun-to-read synthesis will help diverse readers everywhere to grasp and harness how our complex world really works.\"<strong>--Amory B. Lovins, Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute</strong></p>\n<p>\"Dana Meadows taught a generation of students, friends, and colleagues the art and science of thinking beyond conventional boundaries. For her systems thinking included the expected things like recognizing patterns, connections, leverage points, feedback loops and also the human qualities of judgment, foresight, and kindness. She was a teacher with insight and heart. This long anticipated book, the distillation of her life's work, is a gem.\"<strong>--David Orr, Professor of Environmental Studies and Politics, Oberlin College</strong></p>\n<p>\"The publication of <em>Thinking in Systems</em> is a landmark. To live sustainably on our planet, we must learn to understand human-environment interactions as complex systems marked by the impact of human actions, the prominence of nonlinear change, the importance of initial conditions, and the significance of emergent properties. Dana Meadows' final contribution is the best and most accessible introduction to this way of thinking we have. This book is destined to shape our understanding of socio-ecological systems in the years to come in much the same way that Silent Spring taught us to understand the nature of ecosystems in the 1960s and 1970s.\"<strong>--Oran R. Young, Professor, Donald Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at University of California, Santa Barbara</strong></p>\n<p>\"<em>Thinking in Systems</em> is required reading for anyone hoping to run a successful company, community, or country. Learning how to think in systems is now part of change-agent literacy. And this is the best book of its kind.\"<strong>--Hunter Lovins, founder and President of Natural Capital Solutions and coauthor of *Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution</strong>*</p>\n<p>\"Dana Meadows was one of the smartest people I ever knew, able to figure out the sensible answer to almost any problem. This book explains how she thought, and hence is of immense value to those of us who often wonder what she'd make of some new problem. A classic.\"<strong>--Bill McKibben, author of *Deep Economy</strong>*</p>\n<p>\"An inspiring sequel to Dana Meadows' lifetime of seminal contributions to systems thinking, this highly accessible book should be read by everyone concerned with the world's future and how we can make it as good as it possibly can be.\"<strong>--Peter H. Raven, President, Missouri Botanical Garden</strong></p>\n<p>\"Few matched Dana Meadows remarkable blend of eloquence and clarity in making systems thinking understandable. When Dana began her career, the field was esoteric and academic. Today it is the sine quo non for intelligent action in business and society. The publication of Meadows' previously unfinished manuscript is a gift for leaders of all sorts and at all levels.\"<strong>--Peter M. Senge, author of <em>The Fifth Discipline</em> and *The Necessary Revolution</strong>*</p></div>",

From Edward Lorenz’s discovery of the Butterfly Effect, to Mitchell Feigenbaum’s calculation of a universal constant, to Benoit Mandelbrot’s concept of fractals, which created a new geometry of nature, Gleick’s engaging narrative focuses on the key figures whose genius converged to chart an innovative direction for science. In <em>Chaos</em>,Gleick makes the story of chaos theory not only fascinating but also accessible to beginners, and opens our eyes to a surprising new view of the universe.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Few writers distinguish themselves by their ability to write about complicated, even obscure topics clearly and engagingly. James Gleick, a former science writer for the <em>New York Times</em>, resides in this exclusive category. In <em>Chaos</em>, he takes on the job of depicting the first years of the study of chaos--the seemingly random patterns that characterize many natural phenomena.</p><p>This is not a purely technical book. Instead, it focuses as much on the scientists studying chaos as on the chaos itself. In the pages of Gleick's book, the reader meets dozens of extraordinary and eccentric people. For instance, Mitchell Feigenbaum, who constructed and regulated his life by a 26-hour clock and watched his waking hours come in and out of phase with those of his coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p><p>As for chaos itself, Gleick does an outstanding job of explaining the thought processes and investigative techniques that researchers bring to bear on chaos problems. Rather than attempt to explain Julia sets, Lorenz attractors, and the Mandelbrot Set with gigantically complicated equations, <em>Chaos</em> relies on sketches, photographs, and Gleick's wonderful descriptive prose. </p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Science readers who have gone through relativity theory, quantum physics, Heisenbergian uncertainty, black holes and the world of quarks and virtual particles only to be stunned by recent Grand Unified Theories (GUTS) will welcome New York Times science writer Gleick's adventurous attempt to describe the revolutionary science of chaos. \"Chaos\" is what a handful of theorists steeped in math and computer know-how are calling their challengingly abstract new look at nature in terms of nonlinear dynamics. Gleick traces the ideas of these little-known pioneersincluding Mitchell Feigenbaum and his Butterfly Effect; Benoit Mandelbrot, whose \"fractal\" concept led to a new geometry of nature; and Joseph Ford who countered Einstein with \"God plays dice with the universe. But they're loaded dice.\" Chaos is deep, even frightening in its holistic embrace of nature as paradoxically complex, wildly disorderly, random and yet stable in its infinite stream of \"self-similarities.\" A ground-breaking book about what seems to be the future of physics.

        "description": "El WEN-TZU, conocido como «la comprensión de los misterios», es una de las grandes obras clásicas taoístas y fue escrito hace más de dos mil años. Su autor, discípulo de Lao Tse, habría recogido directamente las palabras del maestro, aunque esta hipótesis puede no ser real, y es probable que lo escribiera basándose en el conocimiento de su escuela. La primera noticia de esta recopilación y del discípulo que la efectuó se encuentra en la obra de Ssu-ma Ch’ien «Registros del Gran Historiador», del año 145 antes de Cristo. Olvidada, salvo por un reducido grupo de iniciados, esta versión de Cleary saca a la luz un texto hasta ahora inédito en Occidente. La obra gira en torno a las enseñanzas del «Tao Te King», y puede ser considerada como una continuación del mismo, ya que su contenido penetra en la comprensión del misterio del Tao, permitiendo al lector iniciado reconocer el mismo aroma de sabiduría en ambos textos. Thomas Cleary, doctorado en Civilizaciones de Asia por la Universidad de Harvard, es una reconocida autoridad mundial en doctrinas y lenguas orientales. Ha traducido más de treinta textos clásicos de Oriente, destacando sus modernas versiones y estudios del «I Ching» y de «El arte de la guerra».",
